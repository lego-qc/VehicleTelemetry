Vehicle Telemetry
===

This piece of software provides an extensible interface for working with remote controlled or otherwise distant vehicles. The main goal of it is to track down a quadcopter on the map in real-time. Additionally, it displays various telemetry data sent by the copter, including power consumption, engine RPM, battery state and motion. The interface is extensible so later an interface to command the copter can also be added.
